Mac OS X safe mode performs certain checks, such as verifying the startup disk, repairing directory problems, and loading the necessary kernel extensions. In addition, Mac safe mode prevents Startup items and login items from opening automatically. OS X safe mode also disables user installed fonts.


## Does safe mode erase data Mac?

A Safe Boot will not erase files, something else is going on. Assuming you have been using Time Machine or some other backup system all of your files are fine. If you have not backup then you can attempt to use Data Rescue ($99) and see if you can recover anything.
